## Code Desgin and Architect
I tried to apply S.O.L.I.D principles & use some design pattern and Hydrate everything into object as possible.

#### Patterns used:
- ``Service Pattern``  Calling repository & prepare data before response.
- ``Facade Pattern``   Dynamically recieve objects with different implementations .
- ``Repository Pattern``   Retrieving data and aggregate multiple processes
- ``Composite Entity Pattern``  Applying composition and relations between Entities.
- ``Transformer Pattern``  Transform response object to and JSONable type like Array .
